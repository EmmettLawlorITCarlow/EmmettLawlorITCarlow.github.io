<h1> Welcome To My Website </h1> 

<p id="para1"> My name is Emmett Lawlor and i'm currently a student at Carlow IT. I keep myself energized &amp; focused by consuming a lot of Coca-Cola&reg; products, as they are full of sugar and help with short term energy. This website is completed as my web authoring assignment. If I believed it would effect my grade, I would insert some nice text about our lecturer who taught us html. <em>Unfortunately</em> I don't believe that he would be swayed by it when marking my assignment. Here you will find some information about me. When i'm not struggling through coding, you can find me doing much less resistant activities, playing music, gaming and kicking back. Someday you might even see me publish a website on basic HTML, titled something like HTML For Dummies&trade;. </p>

<h2> Music </h2>

<p id="para2"> Music is a pretty huge passion of mine, from listening to it, to playing it, I love it all. I can say that I know the fundementals on quite a few instruments, but if I had to name a favourite it would have to be the piano. It is a true workstation instrument, I would argue that what a computer is to a coder, a piano is to a musician. </p>

<h2> Gaming </h2> 

<p id="para2"> If i'm being honest I probably spend too much time doing it as it doesn't really benefit me in a way that justifies spending so much time on it. My friend says that they mostly feel <em><q>replaced by it</q></em>. Lets explore my general tendencies when it comes to gaming.

<h2> <strong> The <em>general</em> trail of events; </strong> </h2>
<li>  Boot up a game. </li>
<li>  Decide on an amount of time to play it. </li>
<li>  Low willpower kicks in and I tell myself <strong><em><q>just one more game</q></em></strong>. </li>
<li>  Convince myself that I <strong><em>can</em></strong> afford more time</em>. </li>
<li>  Release how long i've spent. </li>
<li>  <strong>Stop</strong>. </li>
<li>  Rinse and repeat. </li>
